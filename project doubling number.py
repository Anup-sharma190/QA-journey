#Doubling Numbers with For Loop
#Create a list of numbers: [1, 4, 7, 10].
#Use a for loop to iterate through the list.
#Inside the loop, print each number multiplied by 3.
l=[1,4,7,10]
for x in l:
    l[0]=1*3
    l[1]=4*3
    l[2]=7*3
    l[3]=10*3
print(l)
# this is to get result in list formate but want result in simple number formate
l = [1,4,7,10]
for x in l:
    print(x*3)
#this givr result in single number formate
